EXTD=s, Inc.\n\nOriginally Released May 8, 2001\n\nAMG EXPERT REVIEW: 
EXTD= Paul McCartney always got the short end of the stick when he was
EXTD= in the Beatles and again in the '70s, as he and his erstwhile pa
EXTD=rtner John Lennon pursued solo careers. McCartney was attacked fo
EXTD=r his virtues -- for his melodicism and his domesticity, along wi
EXTD=th his desire to form a real touring band following the Beatles. 
EXTD=None of these were celebrated at the time, but he moved many, man
EXTD=y records and sold countless concert tickets, which only hardened
EXTD= opposition toward him. But, in retrospect, McCartney's albums ma
EXTD=ke for the most fascinating body of work among any of the ex-Beat
EXTD=les, and really among any of his peers. Yes, there were pitfalls 
EXTD=among the heights, but that's part of what makes his career so fa
EXTD=scinating -- each record is distinctive, and even if the songs th
EXTD=emselves are shallow, at least lyrically, the melodic skill and s
EXTD=tudio savvy behind each are hard not to admire. This may require 
EXTD=a bit of conversion, and if you're not up to trudging through his
EXTD= individual works, even such masterworks as Ram (truly the roots 
EXTD=of homemade pop), the double-disc set Wingspan is ideal. McCartne
EXTD=y has had a number of career overviews before, including such see
EXTD=mingly comprehensive discs as All the Best, but those were plague
EXTD=d by vaguely haphazard sequencing. This is nearly perfectly execu
EXTD=ted, dividing McCartney's career between the "hits" and "history,
EXTD=" with the latter being devoted to album tracks that are acknowle
EXTD=dged classics, yet never were singles. Now, it's true that this i
EXTD=sn't completely comprehensive -- some will notice that superstar 
EXTD=duets with Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson are missing, and oth
EXTD=ers will wonder where such terrific latter-day singles as "Press"
EXTD= are or why such charting hits as "So Bad" are bypassed, or why a
EXTD=lbum tracks like "Ballroom Dancing" are absent -- but nothing has
EXTD= come as close to capturing the quirky brilliance of McCartney's 
EXTD=solo career, how it balanced whimsical pop with unabashedly senti
EXTD=mental romantic ballads, piledriving rockers, and anything in bet
EXTD=ween. And what makes Wingspan so impressive is how the "History" 
EXTD=disc fills in the gaps that "Hits" leaves, whether it's on the tr
EXTD=emendous "Maybe I'm Amazed" (one of the very best songs he ever w
EXTD=rote), the charming "Junk," the clever "Take It Away," or such ab
EXTD=solutely stunning miniatures as "Heart of the Country," an effort
EXTD=less folk-pop tune that ranks among his very best songs. That's w
EXTD=hy Wingspan isn't just a good hits collection -- it's a convincin
EXTD=g argument that McCartney's solo recordings are a rich, idiosyncr
EXTD=atic body of work of their own merits. Ram, Red Rose Speedway, an
EXTD=d London Town all have their merits, but if you need to be conver

EXTD=ike "Band On The Run," "Jet," "Junior's Farm," and "Hi Hi Hi."\n\n
EXTD=Along the way McCartney and Wings had a hand in a few pop-culture
EXTD= milestones. Among the most notable were creating arguably the gr
EXTD=eatest James Bond theme to date ("Live and Let Die") and topping 
EXTD=the UK charts at the height of the 1977 punk revolution and a mod
EXTD=ern Celtic folk anthem ("Mull Of Kintyre"). Other more obscure bu

EXTD=EF and Kampuchean refugees) and a live version of the ultra-funky
EXTD= "Coming Up" recorded at a Glasgow concert.\n\nIndustry Reviews\n

EXTD=\nThe rest of the so-called "hits and history" -- which is, oddly
EXTD=, put together in no particular order -- are blips from his first

EXTD= \nReviewer: A music fan from Golden Valley, MN USA\n\nAlthough I
EXTD= couldn't be happier to see he finally released a compilation, I 
EXTD=have to say I'm slightly disappointed that not ALL his songs that
EXTD= were hits made it in. I know this is a Wings compilation, but it
EXTD= does include others with which Wings is not listed. SO...here's 
EXTD=a complete list of McCartney hits that are NOT included (17 out o
EXTD=f 37), as researched using Joel Whitburn's Billboard Book of Top 
EXTD=40 Hits, 6th Edition:\n\n(numbers in parenthesis indicate chart p

EXTD= 8, 2001 \nReviewer: Paul Ramone from New York, NY\n\nAh, Macca. 
EXTD=First let's begin by saying this is a very good, almost excellent
EXTD= collection... but what could have been...\n\nThe reason this is 
EXTD=not a five star review is the fact that there are some mistakes (
EXTD=from my perspective anyway) with the release. It has more to do w
EXTD=ith song selection than anything else. First, the 'hits' side of 
EXTD=the package is almost a duplicate of his 'All the Best,' which di
EXTD=dn't bear identical repeating. True, Paul has learned to self edi
EXTD=t - notice he's omitted Say, Say Say and Ebony and Ivory from thi
EXTD=s CD and included Hi, Hi Hi, Mull of Kintyre and Pipes of Peace a
EXTD=s replacements. An improvement on all counts. He should have dele
EXTD=ted 'Goodnight Tonight' as well as substituting perhaps 'Getting 
EXTD=Closer' from Back to the Egg or even the excellent Girl's School,
EXTD= a b-side. The History side is far more interesting including mor
EXTD=e cuts from the 'McCartney' album and the excellent 'Back Seat of
EXTD= My Car' off of Ram (Heart of the Country and Too Many People are
EXTD= good too). I would have rather seen 'Here Today' from Tug of War
EXTD= than either Take it Away or the title track from that album. Gla
EXTD=d he included 'Helen Wheels', but would have preferred 'I'm Carry
EXTD=ing' off of London Town to 'Girfriend,' which is included. Hope h
EXTD=e sees fit sometime in the future to include some rarities - e.g.
EXTD= a recording of one of his best post-Beatles songs that he gave t
EXTD=o the Everly Brothers -"On the Wings of a Nightengale" on a futur
EXTD=e CD. 'Nightengale' would have been more welcome than two version
EXTD=s of 'No More Lonely Nights' or even 'Bluebird' which is dispensa
EXTD=ble. Still, I like the inclusion of 'Waterfalls' and 'Rockestra' 
EXTD=and would have enjoyed hearing another 'Back to the Egg' cut.\n\n
EXTD=Anyway, minor quibbles aside. It brings back good memories and is
EXTD= worth the price of admission.\n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nM
EXTD=acca's hits, not always his best music, April 13, 2004 \nBy  Cand
EXTD=ace Scott (Lake Arrowhead, CA, USA)\n\nSerious or even marginally
EXTD= serious McCartney fans will already have all these songs on vari
EXTD=ous other albums and greatest hits packages. But it's convenient 
EXTD=to have all of these songs on two CD's, especially if you're list
EXTD=ening to the music in a car. It's impossible not to give such won
EXTD=derful music 5 stars, but there are some serious omissions and pr
EXTD=oblems with this collection.\n\n1. There are seven songs edited f
EXTD=or brevity. A casual listener will never notice the changes, but 
EXTD=to all of us who grew up in the 70's and memorized every downbeat
EXTD= and nuance, you will most definitely notice. It's very irritatin
EXTD=g to hear Junior's Farm butchered by more than two minutes and Ve
EXTD=nus and Mars cut to shreds. There are other glaring examples. As 
EXTD=explained on the liner notes, these are the "single edits" releas
EXTD=ed to DJ's of the era, but there's no excuse for these versions a
EXTD=ppearing on a quasi-offical collection, selected by Paul himself.
EXTD=\n\nThe playlist contains all of Wings hits and even sneaks in so
EXTD=me solo Paul work from the early 80's. Since they include Take it
EXTD= Away and Pipes of Peace, why do they neglect much superior songs
EXTD= from the same years, such as the beautiful Here Today, or Averag
EXTD=e Person? There are also some curious inclusions which should nev
EXTD=er have seen the light of the day on a greatest hits package: Bip
EXTD= Bop, Man We Was Lonely and Tomorrow should have been replaced wi
EXTD=th Sally G., Girls School, I'm Carrying and Nineteen Eighty Five.
EXTD=\n\nMcCartney fans will always quibble about such things, but res
EXTD=t assured, you'll get your money's worth on this eclectic, fantas
EXTD=tic collection. No one in the history of popular music could cons
EXTD=istently write so many catchy tunes. If you're new to the solo ye
EXTD=ars of McCartney, this is *the* disc to buy first. \n\n\nAMAZON.C
EXTD=OM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA good, though as usual faulty, compilation, 
EXTD=May 12, 2001 \nBy  Michael Topper (Pacific Palisades, California 
EXTD=United States)\n\nWingspan covers the first fifteen years of McCa
EXTD=rtney's post-Beatle career--with and without Wings, hence the puz
EXTD=zlement of labelling it "Wingspan"--and as such is long overdue. 
EXTD=The two-disc anthology format is perfect for an artist like McCar
EXTD=tney, who has released so many spotty solo albums and quality non
EXTD=-album singles over his career. That the last five studio albums 
EXTD=("Press To Play", "Flowers In The Dirt", "Off The Ground", "Run D
EXTD=evil Run" and "Flaming Pie") have been left off is nothing to wor
EXTD=ry over, considering that the 50s throwback "Run Devil Run" (and 
EXTD=perhaps bits of "Off The Ground") is the only essential one out o
EXTD=f these. It is also curious that for the insistence that Wings wa
EXTD=s a *group*, no Denny or Linda efforts make it onto this set (not
EXTD= that any of their songs really mattered, or that any of this nam
EXTD=ing business really matters in the long run). So what about the m
EXTD=usic contained herein? All the hits are here, as are what Paul co
EXTD=nsiders the best of the album tracks, and this is where one can g
EXTD=et nitpicky. I would've nixed tracks like "Man We Was Lonely", "H
EXTD=eart Of The Country", "Girlfriend", the "Bip Bop" medley (though 
EXTD=interesting) and the second, useless version of "No More Lonely N
EXTD=ights". In their stead should've gone "Teddy Boy", "Little Lamb D
EXTD=ragonfly" (one of the most overlooked songs in his catalogue), "T
EXTD=reat Her Gently", the exquisite, almost futuristic-medieval "Love
EXTD= In Song", "Backwards Traveller" and the essential "Here Today", 
EXTD=his song about Lennon's death. Is any of this up to the standard 
EXTD=of The Beatles? With the exception of "Maybe I'm Amazed"--no. The
EXTD=re are no "Eleanor Rigby's", "Penny Lane's" or "You Never Give Me
EXTD= Your Moneys" here. McCartney was content to compose nice melodie
EXTD=s and--in his best work during the Band On The Run/Venus And Mars
EXTD= era--give his songs some great arrangements. But as a lyricist, 
EXTD=he struggled mightily without someone to feedback with, and it sh
EXTD=ows. Still, overall this is the best comp of Paul's work, making 
EXTD=the previous Greatest Hits collections irrelevant. \n\n\nAMAZON.C
EXTD=OM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nSpinning the Span, May 30, 2001 \nBy  B Donly
EXTD=n (NY, NY)\n\nFor the price and the value this 2CD set is worth w
EXTD=hile. I bought the more expensive version with the hologrammed co
EXTD=ver. Don't bother. I was told the booklet was different. It isn't
EXTD=. Save your money and go with the regular priced set. \n\nThe onl
EXTD=y 2 gripes I have are: the non-existence of material other than P
EXTD=aul's. Yes, it was his band, but he goes on and on in the TV that
EXTD= it was a real band. Well, he could've included Denny Laine's Tim
EXTD=e to Hide, and maybe even Deliver Your Children. \n\nTHe other gr
EXTD=ipe is the lack of respect Paul has for some of his own material.
EXTD= "McCartney" is heavily represented with 5 songs while Back to th
EXTD=e Egg, London Town, Red Rose Speedway get one song each. \n\nHope
EXTD=fully the Box Set that comes out in December will include all the
EXTD= B-sides, plus all the fan's favorite outtakes and bootlegged son
EXTD=gs, and live material from the 1973-75 and 1979 tours. \n\n\nAMAZ
