EXTD=a lavish two-CD set accompanying a cable TV special and home video, released at his commercial trough. Denver performs 
EXTD=most of his Top Ten hits from the '70s (but not "Thank God I'm a Country Boy," the big hit off the last live album), ge
EXTD=tting the bulk of them out of the way early on the first disc. He adds some well-chosen covers by folk peers such as Da
EXTD=vid Mallett (the antiwar "You Say the Battle Is Over") and Tom Paxton ("Bet on the Blues"), selects some of his better
EXTD=, if less familiar, songs of the last decade ("The Harder They Fall," "Falling Out of Love"), and introduces new materi
EXTD=al touching on his favorite romantic ("Is It Love?") and political/philosophical ("Amazon") themes. With such a balance

EXTD=his career in 5.1 surround sound and equally crisp video. A string section accompanies Denver on favorites such as "Cou

EXTD=s mirrored by the wildlife footage also featured in the video. An interview with Denver and a biography round out this 
EXTD=adequate DVD, which is basically a straight transfer of the original VHS version. However, Denver's crowd-pleasing perf

EXTD=e (two?) to get if you can only get one, July 25, 2000 \nBy  William Adair\n\nJohn Denver's sincerity has made him an o
EXTD=bject of ridicule to those who prefer indifferent ambivalence to emotional honesty. So fans like myself, ever aware of 
EXTD=their precarious social standing, have been driven underground, and dare not hum "Sunshine on my shoulders" in public.\
EXTD=n\nHide no more! Even the most cynical are astonished by the power of these performances. I'm even allowed (nay, reques
EXTD=ted) to play these CDs in the office! John gives his all on these tunes; it was, after all, the "Wildlife Concert," a b
EXTD=enefit for The Wildlife Conservation Society. This version of "Rocky Mountain High," with its driving percussion and so
EXTD=aring vocals, should be definitive. And I love the inclusion of some of my favorite older tunes, including "Darcy Farro
EXTD=w" (sublime) and "I Guess He'd Rather be in Colorado." The most popular songs, including "Country Roads" and "Back Hom
EXTD=e Again" live up to your highest expectations. "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" is the only obvious omission, but you won'
EXTD=t miss it.\n\nMany years ago (long before John did this concert, back when his glasses were still round) I was a first-
EXTD=year college engineering student heading towards a lifetime of stressful drudgery and a stomach full of ulcers. I came 
EXTD=to John Denver's music as a way to relieve the anxiety and "escape reality." As I was listening to "Rocky Mountain High
EXTD=" after one particularly awful day, I realized that reality is what you make of it, and I'm a professional ecologist (a
EXTD=nd ulcer-free) today. I had an opportunity to tell John this story after a concert in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and he ac
EXTD=tually said thanks for the inspiration. Can you imagine?\n\n"The Wildlife Concert" is a must for old diehards and proba
EXTD=bly the best John Denver CD for everyone else. And while you're buying this CD, send a few bucks to The Wildlife Conser
EXTD=vation Society- John would certainly have appreciated it. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nNever Better, August 25, 20
EXTD=04 \nBy  Robert Morris (Dallas, Texas)\n\nOver the years, I have purchased most of John Denver's LPs and then CDs, and 
EXTD=also observed several of his performances on television. (Regrettably, I was never in the audience at one of his concer
EXTD=ts.) Recently I saw the PBS program during which the program on this DVD was recorded over a two-day period. Denver ha
EXTD=s never sounded better nor seemed happier than he does during The WILDLife Concert, totally comfortable playing a rich 
EXTD=and diverse selection of older and newer songs. How rare and commendable that he makes each of the 25 seem so fresh. H
EXTD=e is joined by immensely talented associates, notably James Burton, Jim Horn, and Pete Huttinger. FYI, this two-disc C
EXTD=D and its companion DVD include the previously unreleased "For You" which is not available elsewhere. I lack the talen

EXTD=The Best - by THE BEST!, January 13, 2000 \nBy  MrsDM (Near Chicago, IL)\n\nI have listened to John Denver for about 3
EXTD=0 years now... his music takes me to a wonderful "comfort zone" where I only hear the words, the music and the voice..
EXTD=. nothing outside of that bothers me. For someone who was over 50 years old at the time of this release, he hit some tr
EXTD=uly great notes on this live concert that would put some of these young pups to shame! This version of "For You" is so 
EXTD=STRONG - you can feel the emotion and passion... He truly was - IS - a master talent when it comes to BEING HUMAN ! Tha

EXTD=e "Thank God I'm A Country Boy" and "Grandma's Feather Bed" gave John Denver an undeserved reputation as a purveyor of 
EXTD=corniness. Songs like "Rocky Mountain High,""Poems, Prayers, and Promises" and countless others showcase the songwritin

EXTD=he great surprise of this CD are the inclusion of great songs that, unless you are a serious JD collector, would not b
EXTD=e known to most listeners. \n\nI've always loved John Denver, not only because of the beauty of his songs and his commi
EXTD=ttment to various causes, but because he is the only artist whose songs speak to me. Love the outdoors? Then "Rocky Mou

EXTD=lems with the one you love? "Two Different Directions." Ever contemplate what you might have done differently with you
EXTD=r life? "Whispering Jesse" - one of the gems I uncovered on this CD, and truly one of his great songs.\n\nThe old clich
EXTD=e is that, "if you could only own one CD"....well, that would be a shame, because there are many other great John Denve
EXTD=r CDs...but, if you could only own one CD... \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nJohn Is Back !, June 1, 2006 \nBy  Mat C
EXTD=lark (Missouri)\n\nI purchased my first copy of this album and the video when it was released in 1995. I have since the
EXTD=n worn that copy out, so I recently purchased a new CD. \n\nThis is a fantastic live album with John re-visiting much o
EXTD=f his earlier work. He was able to successfully integrate those songs with newer compositions. The manner in which he r
EXTD=e-worked Rocky Mountain High gives the song new life, you can't help but sing along with John. There are too many track
EXTD=s to discuss each one effectively, so I will emphasize just a few of them. I was disappointed that Different Direction
EXTD=s was not on the CD, although it is on the video. A Song for All Lovers is a beautiful tribute to his friend Marti. \n\
EXTD=nMy absolute favorite song on this album is For You. This beautiful love song is embraced by John's silky smooth voice
EXTD=, a small string orchestra, and John on the piano. For You stands very strong alongside Annie's Song as one of the mos
EXTD=t beautiful songs ever written. \n\nThis is an album that I never have grown tired of listening to. It will remain one 
EXTD=of John's best albums ever released. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA Very Special Perfomer, February 13, 2000 \nBy
EXTD=  C. Kuschel-Toerber "Christian Kuschel" (Frankfurt, Hessen)\n\nI bought this double live CD upon its release in 1995, 
EXTD=shortly before I saw JD live on stage for the sixth and very last time (and he was not in a very good mood that Octobe
EXTD=r night, I'm afraid). Anyway, I'd like to point out that John's voice and performing skills were at the peak in the 90'
EXTD=s, sadly long after his commercial pinnacle (and RCA dropping him, very unfairly in my opinion). Listening to these 2.
EXTD=5 hours of classic JD taped in February 1995 will probably even warm the harshest critic's heart; the emotions pouring 
EXTD=forth from this man were just incredible. The live recordings sound so much better than the original technically substa
EXTD=ndard RCA tracks, and the mix of big hits and rare album tracks is fantastic.\n\nJohn Denver, both as a very special hu
EXTD=man being and as an outstanding musician, has been a part of my daily life for a very long time, and this is the perfec
EXTD=t legacy & a truely great recording. By the way: Check out JD's best albums, "Higher Ground" (1988) and "The Flower Tha
EXTD=t Shattered the Stone" (1989), unfortunately not (yet) listed at Amazon.\n\nRest in peace, John - and thanks! \n\n\nAMA

EXTD=weeks before he died. He was playing with the Houston Symphony Orchestra and was so full of energy. I stopped on the wa
EXTD=y home and purchased this collection. For the next year, it was all I played in my car and at home. I think it is the b

EXTD=IEW\nExcellent summing up of JD's career..., January 14, 2002 \nBy  William E. Adams (Midland, Texas USA)\n\nThis is a 
EXTD=late career performance (l995) of mostly early hits, and to my taste, John sounds as good or better than he ever did. H
EXTD=is love of performing shines through here, and his stage presence wins you over and takes you back to the days of 20 ye
EXTD=ars earlier when getting the new JD album was a duty, not a joke. I am very pleased with this double-CD. I have either 
EXTD=owned, or heard, almost everything John released over the decades, and this one is worthy to stand with the best. The c
EXTD=oncert was filmed and shown on PBS a few years ago, and when I watched it I was amazed at his energy, stamina and enthu
EXTD=siasm. By l995, nobody was buying his newer songs, and few were admitting even to having loved his previous work. But w
EXTD=e did love that stuff in the 60's and 70's, and it was good. This concert brings back that innocence and joy and remind
EXTD=s us that JD was indeed, a great talent. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nDenver grown up, November 27, 2005 \nBy  Elf

EXTD=m the 70's, as he aged his voice developed a rich maturity that is a pleasure to hear. And his newer original songs hav
EXTD=e depth and an edge that his early hits did not. I was annoyed to read a number of obituaries after he died that dismis

EXTD=ON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nA good effort, but a bit uneven., May 28, 2002 \nBy  W. Foley (Canandaigua NY)\n\nThis is an up
EXTD=dated review. First of all this is not a bad CD. It is just that I didn't like the song selection, it could have includ
EXTD=ed more environmental songs like, "Windsong" "Boy From the Country" "American Child" "The Eagle and The Hawk" "Childre
EXTD=n of the Universe." Also, I think at times his voice was not as good as I had heard it back in the mid to late 80s, whe
EXTD=n I think it was at its peak. \n\nI understand that this CD was also meant to jump-start his career. That is why I was 
EXTD=a little disappointed in the song selection. Songs like "Bet on the Blues" did display JD's versatility, but, however, 
EXTD=it was like he was selling out to recapture past glories. The song "The Harder They Fall" is another example of JD tryi
EXTD=ng to be diverse, but I just don't care for the song. On songs like Matthew (a big favorite of mine) JD sounds straine
EXTD=d and heavy handed on this rendition. The same could be said for "Leaving On A Jet Plane/Goodbye Again". He sounds as i
EXTD=f he was laboring under these pieces. \n\nOkay, onto some positive aspects of this CD. It was great to have a live rend
EXTD=ition of "Darcy Farrow", and JD delivers this with care and sensitivity to the tragedy of the lyrics. This album showca
EXTD=sed JD's new band members. He was returning to a more acoustic sound after years of James Burton's electric guitars an
EXTD=d Jim Horn's sax and flutes (which I never really cared for). I think the new band was a step in the right direction. T
EXTD=he best version of "I Guess He'd Rather Be In Colorado" is on this CD. It is accentuated with Pete Huttlingers great le
EXTD=ad work. John Denver's cover of the Grateful Dead's song "Me And My Uncle" turns the song into a pure out-law western s
EXTD=ong that is punctuated with Alan Deremo's sizzling bass solo. Other gems on this CD are great live renderings of "Eagle
EXTD=s and Horses", "Calypso", and "Amazon". "Rhymes and Reason", a song that is prophetic and hopeful in the aftermath of t
EXTD=he September 11th tragedies, is delivered with stirring and unabashed heartfelt elegance. Also on this CD is John's bea
EXTD=utiful love song "For You." That should have been, could have been, a great hit single. \n\nHe closes the CD with the u
EXTD=sual end of the concert staple "This Old Guitar." This is generally one of my favorite songs, but he administers this s
EXTD=election as if he was just going through the motions. But Listen to the version on "An Evening With John Denver" and I 
EXTD=think you'll see the difference. \n\n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\na wonderful music experience, September 20, 2007 \nB

EXTD=beautiful. The oh-so-familiar songs (Annie's Song, Calypso, Back Home Again, etc.) are like visiting old friends - so c

EXTD=t the video of his concert which starts with "Eagles and Horses" that begins with running horses. WO! What I was reall
EXTD=y impressed with is his song "For You". For those who have the video, I bet you were as surprised as I was when you sa
EXTD=w him play the piano on that song. I didn't know he could play the piano and what a soft touch he had on it. On PBS the

EXTD=oke about a friend of his who loved to dance with her "beloved" who passed away years before, and he then played "A Son
EXTD=g For All Lovers" which was new for me. I was touched both by the song and John's telling of his friend Marti who was 9
EXTD=3 at the time and inspiration for the song. Nor did I know the background for "Matthew" that he wrote about his father'
EXTD=s brother who passed in a car accident. I didn't know a thing about his father and to hear John mention how many were i
EXTD=n his father's family I felt closer to John. For him to share these snippets of his personal life of his father and Mar
EXTD=ti is something I've never heard other singers do. My favorite is "You Say That The Battle Is Over". He didn't write it
EXTD=, but he was so good at making others' songs 'his'. "Is It Love" was a great 'everybody" song as he told us our part t
EXTD=o sing and the funny part is that when he flubbed the same line he laughed out loud.What a breath of fresh air to know 
EXTD=that he can flub up with the best of them and make it fun. I saw John twice in concert in '76 and '78. He was way too s
EXTD=erious and the only thing he said was that we could sing along which probably bugged everyone around me because I can'
EXTD=t listen to John without singing with him.I also loved "Whispering Jesse" a new song for me and it was quite visual. M
EXTD=y ultimate favorite? "Wild Montana Skies". A couple years ago I got a "Greatist Hits" compilation which had that with E

EXTD=irst time I've seen him without his 'old' hair and round glasses. Made him look older. I hated and refuse to play "Amaz
EXTD=on" "The Harder They Fall" and "Dreamland Express". "Amazon" sounds forced. "The Harder They Fall" took John out of hi
EXTD=s coffe house singer image. He was no rocker despite his daring try. "Dreamland Express" sounds too "trainy" for my tas

EXTD=f is a step down, May 5, 2003 \nBy  tvJeremy (California USA)\n\nJohn, God bless him, recorded this album after his pri
EXTD=me. While this album is nowhere near bad, you can definately hear his voice going. The highs have lost their edge and g
EXTD=ained a little more vibrato. This is why I would not recommend this album for the fans of the older JD stuff. An Evenin
EXTD=g With John Denver is a much greater testament to his former vocal prowess. I have to skip the tracks of Rocky Mountai
EXTD=n High, Rhymes and Reasons, Country Roads, Wild Montana Skies, and Annie's Song because they are so much worse than the
EXTD=y once were. But the album DOES mostly redeem itself. The live versions of his new songs are great and his songwriting 
EXTD=and style are still omnipresent even if his vocal range and purity aren't. Eagles and Horses, Shanghai Breezes, Leavin
EXTD=g on a Jet Plane Medley, Amazon, A Song for All Lovers, and Calypso are great in this live version. I would ABSOLUTELY 
EXTD=recommend this to anyone who hasn't heard John's earlier stuff, and to die hard fans, but this is not for the casual J
EXTD=D fan who enjoys his earlier stuff. The vocal change will drive you nuts.
