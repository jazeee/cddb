EXTD= lot of bands were embracing pop-Christianity (a la Jesus Christ 
EXTD=Superstar), Aqualung was a bold statement for a rock group, a pro
EXTD=-God anti-church tract that probably got lots of teenagers wrestl
EXTD=ing with these ideas for the first time in their lives. This was 
EXTD=the album that made Jethro Tull a fixture on FM radio, with riff-
EXTD=heavy songs like "My God," "Hymn 43," "Locomotive Breath," "Cross
EXTD=-Eyed Mary," "Wind Up," and the title track. And from there, they
EXTD= became a major arena act, and a fixture at the top of the record
EXTD= charts for most of the 1970s. Mixing hard rock and folk melodies
EXTD= with Ian Anderson's dour musings on faith and religion (mostly h
EXTD=ow organized religion had restricted man's relationship with God)
EXTD=, the record was extremely profound for a number seven chart hit,
EXTD= one of the most cerebral albums ever to reach millions of rock l
EXTD=isteners. Indeed, from this point on, Anderson and company were c
EXTD=ompelled to stretch the lyrical envelope right to the breaking po
EXTD=int. As a compact disc, Aqualung has gone through numerous editio
EXTD=ns, mostly owing to problems finding an original master tape when
EXTD= the CD boom began. When the album was issued by Chrysalis throug
EXTD=h Columbia Records in the mid-1980's, the source tape was an LP p
EXTD=roduction master, and the first release was criticized for thin, 
EXTD=tinny sound; Columbia remastered it sometime around 1987 or 1988,
EXTD= in a version with better sound. Chrysalis later switched distrib
EXTD=ution to Capitol-EMI, and they released a decent sounding CD that
EXTD= is currently available. Chrysalis also issued a 25th anniversary

EXTD=fter veering sharply from the blues inluences of their debut, Thi
EXTD=s Was, Jethro Tull's sound quickly coalesced around jazz-tinged E

EXTD=s indelibly clichéd trademark--and the band's entrée into a long 
EXTD=reign as arena-rock perennials. But there's a lot more to Aqualun
EXTD=g than the riffage of that cut and its cousins, "Cross-Eyed Mary"
EXTD= and "Locomotive Breath." In an era when pseudo-Christian spiritu

EXTD=this album can. \n\nI am a religious sort and do not agree with m

EXTD=f you only listen to people that agree with you, then you have su

EXTD= is the music. Today's music is made up of new "sounds" that are 
EXTD=good for one, maybe two, songs. Aqualung is not the one dimension
EXTD=al music we are accustomed to today. It will take you on an emoti
EXTD=onal roller coaster. That is a big reason for its continued succe

EXTD=Rockers, March 7, 2002 \nReviewer: Len Czyzniejewski \nWhile it w
EXTD=as the next album, "Thick as a Brick", that made them megastars, 
EXTD="Aqualung", the fourth album by the band, established the Jethro 
EXTD=Tull sound. Not that the first three albums were bad, they weren'
EXTD=t. But the band would never have sold the amount of albums they d
EXTD=id, nor fill the arenas they did with their old sound. To some, t
EXTD=his change may have been as sacreligous as Bob Dylan going from a
EXTD=coustic to electric, but who would have even remembered Jethro Tu
EXTD=ll if not for the change that started with this record? \n\nIt st
EXTD=ill may still be their best, and as a big fan of their "classic" 
EXTD=era, that's saying a lot. From the signature guitar riff that ope
EXTD=ns the title song, to the ending message of "Wind Up", it's loade
EXTD=d with juicy stuff that I've never grown tired of. OK, "Locomotiv
EXTD=e Breath" was played forever on FM radio, but that's because it w
EXTD=as a great song. \n\nIt's loaded with other good stuff, both hard
EXTD= and soft. "Hymn 43" shows him at his angriest. But he also write
EXTD=s a tender love song with "Wond'ring Aloud" "Windup" starts slow,
EXTD= really rocks, and then softly ends to get it's message out one m
EXTD=ore time. \n\nWho knows what kind of message about religion Ian A
EXTD=nderson was trying to convey in those days? It's probably changed
EXTD= over the years, but back then, it did ask some serious questions
EXTD= about how humans view God. Chances are he was a young artist reb
EXTD=elling about everything, and religion is always a nice target. My
EXTD= own interpretation is that there is a bit of God in everything, 
EXTD=including bums like the title character. And the phrase "He's not
EXTD= the kind you have to wind up on Sundays" speaks volumes. \n\nSo 
EXTD=those of you who want to hear music these days instead of watchin
EXTD=g it, buy this classic. If you own it, dust it off and make conta
EXTD=ct with an old friend. \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nOn my way 
EXTD=to Sunday School, September 12, 2000 \nReviewer: katja_r from Mun
EXTD=chen, Germany \nI enjoy listening to this CD. It has a lot to off
EXTD=er. AQUALUNG and LOCOMOTIVE BREATH are classics from the early se
EXTD=venties which are still mainstays of FM radio. Ian Anderson, who 
EXTD=is the song-writer, singer, flautist, heart and soul of JETHRO TU
EXTD=LL created a classic rock 'n roll experience with this album. His
EXTD= cleverness is everywhere on this CD. The AQUALUNG vocal effect w
EXTD=as employed by Maynard on the Tool AENIMA release. Anderson makes
EXTD= a strong argument that the flute can be used as an effective hea
EXTD=vy metal instrument. He matches it against accoustic guitars, hea
EXTD=vy riffs, and even a choral arrangement. The place where Anderson
EXTD='s creative brilliance really shines, though, is in his choice of
EXTD= topic. No other artist has achieved such commercial success whil
EXTD=e at the same time singing such controversial songs. By asserting
EXTD= his views of organized religion forcefully and unadorned, he inf
EXTD=uses this collection with a reason for being. The arguments are n
EXTD=ot new. Basically, Ian Anderson's polemic is that religion instit
EXTD=utionalized loses its relevance for the individual. This is essen
EXTD=tially the same argument of King Hezekiah when he busted up the B
EXTD=ronze Serpant built by Moses. The novelty of the argument matters
EXTD= less than the fact that it is one which compels the listener. It
EXTD= comforts those who feel disaffected by organized religion and it
EXTD= aggitates its proponents. While neither understands that the poi
EXTD=nt is to develop a personal spirituality regardless of whether yo
EXTD=u are inside or outside of an English Church. Superb song-writing
EXTD=, competent musicians and an incendiary argument have helped to m
EXTD=ake this CD a timeless classic. If you are interested in the musi
EXTD=c of the early seventies or would like to excite the vicar ;D, th
EXTD=is CD will be interesting to you. \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\n
EXTD=Tull with attitude and balls to match, July 16, 2002 \nReviewer: 
EXTD=dale caudwell from Comox B.C. Canada \nIt's fair to say that Ian 
EXTD=Anderson was the heart and soul of Jethro Tull but the band was t
EXTD=he essense of the music. Martin Barres guitar work was prominent 
EXTD=with Tulls sound and it was when I heard them perform live in Edm
EXTD=onton back in the mid- seventies that I appreciated the bands tot
EXTD=al work on stage. It was Aqualung, Thick as a Brick and Passion P
EXTD=lay that came out of that tour and all the time, Ian co-ordinated
EXTD= the concert in a conductors fashion, much the same way Jagger wo
EXTD=uld with the Stones. \nAqualung is the true coming of age for Jet
EXTD=hro Tull in that all the stories in the songs were like a renisan
EXTD=ce of time. Anderson had little difficuty telling stories with-in
EXTD= the music and blended the arrangements quite well. My favorites 
EXTD=include the title song along with "Locomotive Breath", "My God", 
EXTD="Hymn 43"and "Wind Up". The CD has bonus tracks which I feel were
EXTD= added to increase the awareness of more music (although the song
EXTD=s are good, they lack the original format that made the album suc
EXTD=h a listening treat). Still I feel that along with Stand Up and B
EXTD=enefit, Jethro Tull was the definitive alternate rock and roll gr
EXTD=oup of the 70's. Pink Floyd was the only other group that made th
EXTD=e attempt to branch out of the norm and make a splash with being 
EXTD=diverse. Buy this and enjoy the ride. It's destined to be a class

EXTD=2002 \nReviewer: handydandy from Westport, CT USA \nAqualung is a
EXTD= wonderful, superlative, essentially perfect album. From the day 
EXTD=it was released right up to now the record is fresh, exciting, co
EXTD=mpelling, intelligent, forcefully rhythmic, melodic, brilliantly 
EXTD=played, brilliantly sung, and has one of the best ever cover illu
EXTD=strations to boot. After nearly thirty years of wearing out vario
EXTD=us copies of it, I have yet to tire of this phenomenal artistic t
EXTD=our de force. \nI had the great good fortune of seeing Jethro Tul
EXTD=l live when they were doing the original Aqualung tour - they wer
EXTD=e hardly known at the time - and as great as the album is, their 
EXTD=performance was even more electrifying. It was at Madison Square 
EXTD=Garden and I was up front, a few feet from the performers.\nAs th
EXTD=e show started the house lights went down and the stage went blac
EXTD=k. Silence. Long pause. Then, hobbling out of the blackness a sin
EXTD=gle spotlight caught Anderson dressed extravagantly like the old 
EXTD=man on the album cover, bent over and leaning on his flute, which
EXTD= he used as a cane. Leering maliciously, slowly creeping up front
EXTD=, he finally stopped, silently grinning out at the house as the a
EXTD=udience howled with delight. Then he threw his flute straight up,
EXTD= high, and the spotlight went up with the flute, shining and spar
EXTD=kling as it twisted its way up and then down, the only thing visi
EXTD=ble in the darkness.\nWhen the flute came back down it was met by
EXTD= Anderson's upraised hand, and at the instant he clutched it all 
EXTD=the stage lights came up and the band struck the thunderous openi
EXTD=ng notes of the album. And it got better and better and better as
EXTD= the show went on, Anderson leaping and snarling and playing flut
EXTD=e at the same time, a truly athletic performance. Whew! I can sti
EXTD=ll see it.\nIf you've somehow denied yourself owning this remarka
EXTD=ble work of art and music, get it now! I wish you many hours of e
EXTD=njoyment listening to this treasure. \n\nA seedy, introspective l

EXTD=t from Redwood City, CA United States \nAs sacrilegious as it may
EXTD= sound for a dyed-in-the-wool Jethro Tull fan to give their high-
EXTD=water mark album less than five stars, I fear I must. But remembe
EXTD=r that four stars is very, very good! "Aqualung" is an album that
EXTD= sounds slightly dated, but at the time of its release, noone had
EXTD= heard anything quite like it and it set many precedents for prog
EXTD=ressive rock bands to follow...though none could (or perhaps want
EXTD=ed to) emulate Jethro Tull. To set the stage, JT had three clever
EXTD=, inventive albums (and several singles) to its credit by 1971. T
EXTD=heir first, "This Was" was very blues-based and had heavy influen
EXTD=ce by original guitarist Mick Abrahams. "Stand Up", the second, w
EXTD=as extremely inventive while being bluesy, yet folk-rocky as well
EXTD=, with a touch of classical. "Benefit", an underrated album, stil
EXTD=l had some blues roots, but went on a psychedelic tangent to grea
EXTD=t effect. Already, the band had made several demands of its fans,
EXTD= going from blues-rock to folk-rock to psychedelic-rock. With "Aq
EXTD=ualung", their fourth, they introduced Elizabethan-metal! They fi
EXTD=nally alienated their original fans, but gained a lot more in the
EXTD= emerging prog-rock arena. It was a transitional album as well; t
EXTD=he last for original drummer Clive Bunker, but the first for bass
EXTD=ist/artist Jeffrey Hammond and the first for keyboard wiz John Ev
EXTD=an(s) as a permanent member. Ian Anderson was very full of piss-a
EXTD=nd-vinegar at the time, and his compositions on "Aqualung" attack
EXTD=ed social categorization (side one) and organized religion (side 
EXTD=two). It was hard to decide whether the hard-hitting music or the
EXTD= colorful, collegiate lyrics affected the fans most, but it was r
EXTD=are for a single album to do both. Unfortunately, many of the arr
EXTD=angements were akin to killing a mosquito with an elephant gun: l
EXTD=ess could have definitely been more. "Cross-Eyed Mary", "My God" 
EXTD=and "Hymn 43" in particular could have benefited from a tad less 
EXTD=of Martin Barre's power chords (LESS, you say?) and David Palmer'
EXTD=s overdone orchestrations. Most of the album, though, had just th
EXTD=e right balance of restraint. To sum, anyone who is building a co
EXTD=llection of classic "must-have" rock albums needs to include Jeth
EXTD=ro Tull's "Aqualung" as well as "Who's Next", "Dark Side of the M
EXTD=oon" or any of the Beatles'. "Aqualung" isn't the most representa
EXTD=tive example of the "'Tull sound", but the group was so bursting 
EXTD=with ideas and talent at a time when genres were new and up for g
EXTD=rabs, they developed a niche all their own and an album to mark t
EXTD=hat time. P.S., a note to all you young'uns: the original release
EXTD= of "Aqualung" had only a single Martin Barre riff at the very be
EXTD=ginning of the title track, then the double was near the coda. No
EXTD=t until the quadraphonic remix of the album (in 1974, and subsequ
EXTD=ently the "M.U." and "Original Masters" collections) was the doub
EXTD=le-riff added. \n\nAMAZON.COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nNot ONE concept al

EXTD=5).\n\nThe leap from 1970's BENEFIT to the following year's AQUAL
EXTD=UNG is one of the most astonishing progressions in rock history. 
EXTD=In the space of one album, Tull went from relatively unassuming e
EXTD=lectrified folk-rock to larger-than-life conceptual rock full of 
EXTD=sophisticated compositions and complex, intellectual lyrical cons
EXTD=tructs. While the leap to full-blown prog-rock wouldn't be taken 
EXTD=until a year later on THICK AS A BRICK, the degree to which Tull 
EXTD=upped the ante here is remarkable.\n\nThe lyrical concept here--t
EXTD=he hypocrisy of Christianity in England--is stronger than on most
EXTD= other '70s conceptual efforts, but it's ultimately the music tha
EXTD=t makes it. Tull's winning way with a riff was never so arresting
EXTD= as on the chugging "Locomotive Breath," or the character studies
EXTD= "Cross Eyed Mary" and "Aqualung," which portray believably seedy
EXTD= participants in Ian Anderson's story. The fable imagery of "Moth
EXTD=er Goose" and the vitriolic anti-authoritarian sentiments of "Win
EXTD=d Up" both serve notice of Anderson's willful iconoclasm and his 
EXTD=disillusionment with the spiritual traditions to which he was bor
EXTD=n. Varied but cohesive, AQUALUNG is widely regarded as Tull's fin

EXTD=LLING STONE REVIEW\nYes were sleeker, Emerson Lake and Palmer wer
EXTD=e grander, and Genesis more ingenious. But Jethro Tull were the m
EXTD=ost frazzled British art rockers of their day. That is never more
EXTD= clear than on the flighty Aqualung, the band's biggest U.S. hit.
EXTD= The title piece begins with some hoary singing from frontman Ian
EXTD= Anderson before everything gets swept up into a fast forest groo
EXTD=ve. "Cross-Eyed Mary" ushers in the flute-over-drums textures tha
EXTD=t became a Tull hallmark; some funk anchors the verses, which dov
EXTD=etail into a cranky singalong chorus. There's a prevailing woodwi
EXTD=nd litheness throughout the album, cut by mad piano runs and the 
EXTD=granite solidity of the drums. A tension is in the background - e
EXTD=ven quiet folk pieces such as "Cheap Day Return" seem to be under
EXTD= some kind of inescapable pressure. But it's on the hell-bent "Lo
EXTD=comotive Breath" that Tull bring their frazzle front and center, 
EXTD=its barrage of clip-clop rhythms doubling and tripling themselves
EXTD= before Anderson can glide off onto one of his harried flute excu
EXTD=rsions.\nAqualung was a bear to make, Anderson has said, because 
EXTD=of the difficulty of hearing all the parts in a Seventies studio.
EXTD= Today, it's the sparse quality of Aqualung you notice - the hand
EXTD=made sound of a band working to convey the kind of anxiety that n
EXTD=ow gets slapped onto tape with much more booming technology but f
EXTD=ar less care.\n(RS 879 - October 11, 2001) -- JAMES HUNTER YEAR:
